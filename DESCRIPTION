Description: Fit Bayesian state-space models to animal tracking
    data. Models provided are DCRW (for location filtering), DCRWS (for
    location filtering and behavioural state estimation), and their hierarchical versions. 
    The models are primarily intended for fitting to ARGOS satellite tracking data but
    options exist to fit to other tracking data types such as GPS and geolocation data. Simplified
    McMC convergence diagnostic plotting is provided but users are encouraged to explore tools
    available in packages such as coda and boa.
