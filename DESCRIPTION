Description: Fit Bayesian state-space models to Argos satellite tracking
    data. Currently, models provided are DCRW (for location filtering), DCRWS (for
    location filtering and behavioural state estimation), and hierarchical models,
    hDCRW and hDCRWS, for location filtering and behavioural state estimation across
    multiple animals, respectively.
