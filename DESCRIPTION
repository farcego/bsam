Description: Fit Bayesian state-space models to Argos satellite tracking data. Currently, models provided are DCRW (for location filtering), DCRWS (for location filtering and behavioural state estimation), and hierarchical models, hDCRW and hDCRWS, for location filtering and behavioural state estimation across multiple animals, respectively.
