## Installation

First ensure that you have a working copy of JAGS for the [rjags](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html) package, see instructions below. 

```R
library(rjags)
```

The `bsam` package may then be installed directly from Github using the `devtools` package. 

```R
## install.packages("devtools")  
devtools::install_github("ianjonsen/bsam")
```
### JAGS installation

Install JAGS: http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/

## Development


Please read [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) for more on this process, especially the Git/Github chapter. 

For developers of `bsam`, simply clone or fork this repository with Git and then create an RStudio project for the package. 

The simplest way to do this is with RStudio: 

1. Install `devtools` and `roxygen2`. 
2. Create a new project `File/New Project` click `Version Control` then `Git` and paste in this project's link "https://github.com/ianjonsen/bsam.git"
3. Click `Tools/Project Options` and click `Build tools` then `Generate documentation with roxygen` and tick on all options. 
4. Hit `Ctrl-SHIFT-b` to "Build and reload". 
5. Hit `Ctrl-SHIFT-e` to run R CMD check
6. Make edits to the source and be happy. 

**NOTE:** Remember to only edit the documentaion in the R script files, the NAMESPACE file and all the "man/*.Rd" files get automatically generated by the build process.
